                  I thought I saw the traces of a simple honest heart.

                  And besides all this, there was a certain lofty bearing about
                  the Pagan, which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim.
                  He looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a
                  creditor. Whether it was, too, that his head being shaved, his
                  forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief, and looked
                  more expansive than it otherwise would, this I will not venture
                  to decide; but certain it was his head was phrenologically an
                  excellent one.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It may seem ridiculous, but it reminded me of General
                  Washington's head, as seen in the popular busts of him. It had
                  the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the
                  brows, which were likewise very projecting, like two long
                  promontories thickly wooded on top. Queequeg was George
                  Washington cannibalistically developed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending
                  meanwhile to be looking out at the storm from the casement, he
                  never heeded my presence, never troubled himself with so much as
                  a single glance; but appeared wholly occupied with counting the
                  pages of the marvellous book. Considering how sociably we had
                  been sleeping together the night previous, and especially
                  considering the affectionate arm I had found thrown over me upon
                  waking in the morning, I thought this indifference of his very
                  strange. But savages are strange beings; at times you do not
                  know exactly how to take them.

                  At first they are overawing; their calm self-collectedness of
                  simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom. I had noticed also that
                  Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little, with the
                  other seamen in the inn. He made no advances whatever; appeared
                  to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances.
                  All this struck me as mighty singular; yet, upon second
                  thoughts, there was something almost sublime in it. Here was a
                  man some twenty thousand miles from home, by the way of Cape
                  Horn, that is—which was the only way he could get there—thrown
                  among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet
                  Jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease; preserving the
                  utmost serenity; content with his own companionship; always
                  equal to himself.

                  of fine philosophy; though no doubt he had never heard there was
                  such a thing as that.
